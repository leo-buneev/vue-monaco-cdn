# vue-monaco-cdn

**This is a version for Vue3. To get version for Vue2, please use `vue-monaco-cdn^1.0.0` (branch v1.x)**

[Monaco Editor](https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-editor) is the code editor that powers VS Code. This project aims to provide simple and lightweight Vue.js component, that downloads editor files lazily from cdn. Forked from [vue-monaco](https://github.com/egoist/vue-monaco/) and adjusted to use CDN with minimal setup.

Similar projects:

* [vue-monaco](https://github.com/egoist/vue-monaco/) - requires bundling monaco editor files via webpack and a special webpack plugin. Sometimes this may be undesirable because:
    * it requires additional webpack configuration
    * webpack processing can lead to [issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-editor-webpack-plugin/issues/17)
    * it can significantly [increase](https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-editor-webpack-plugin/issues/40) webpack bundle size and build time.
* [vue-monaco-editor](https://github.com/matt-oconnell/vue-monaco-editor) - supports CDN but isn't maintained.


## Install

```bash
yarn add vue-monaco-cdn
# or
npm install vue-monaco-cdn
```

## Usage

```vue
<template>
  <monaco-editor
    class="editor"
    v-model="code"
    language="javascript"
  />
  </monaco-editor>
</template>

<script>
import MonacoEditor from 'vue-monaco-cdn'

export default {
  components: {
    MonacoEditor
  },

  data() {
    return {
      code: 'const noop = () => {}'
    }
  }
}
</script>

  height: 400px;
}
</style>
```

### Props

- `modelValue` - code
- `language` - programming language that code will be in. [List of supported languages](https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-languages) 
- `theme` - visual theme for editor
- `options` - [monaco editor additional options](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/api/interfaces/monaco.editor.ieditorconstructionoptions.html)
- `url` - custom CDN url. Default is "https://unpkg.com/browse/monaco-editor@latest/min". Note, that URL must point to a folder, under which path "/vs/base/worker/workerMain.js" must exist.

### Methods

- `getMonaco(): IStandaloneCodeEditor`: Return the [editor instance](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/api/interfaces/monaco.editor.istandalonecodeeditor.html).

Use `ref` to interact with the `MonacoEditor` component in order to access methods: `<MonacoEditor ref="editor"></MonacoEditor>`, then `this.$refs.editor.getMonaco()` will be available.

### Events

- `editorDidMount` - fired after monaco editor was mounted. Recieves monaco instance (`IStandaloneCodeEditor`) as parameter. Use this event to customize monaco instance (for example, add new code formatters)
- `update:modelValue` - fired whenever user changes editor content

For other events, please use `getMonaco()` and subscribe to them directly. See [IStandaloneCodeEditor reference](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/api/interfaces/monaco.editor.istandalonecodeeditor.html) for full events list.
